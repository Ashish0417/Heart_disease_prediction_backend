# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction Backend API

A machine learning-powered FastAPI backend that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical attributes. This backend offers not only predictions but also interpretable results with confidence scores, key contributing factors, and clinical insights.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Heart disease prediction using a trained ML model.
- Rich JSON response including:
  - Prediction value and probability.
  - Uncertainty estimation and reliability score.
  - Abnormal features with severity and explanations.
  - Key contributors with SHAP-like feature importance.
  - Clinical insights and health recommendations.
  - Optional base64 visualization for frontend use.
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation at `/docs`.
- Docker support for easy deployment.
